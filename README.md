Assignment #3 - Get your Time Series Data

# Data Collection Methodology
I found this Time Series on Kaggle and that HTAG Holdings and Terry James collected this data. They have accumulated property sales data for the 2007-2019 period for one specific region. The data contains sales prices for houses and units with 1,2,3,4,5 bedrooms. These are the cross-depended variables. This data was updated annually when being collected. 

# Why Does This Data Set Intrigue Me?
This data set intrigues me because of the number of factors involved. From the number of bedrooms to the postal code, there are so many factors that go into determining the value of a property. Because of this, I was interested in the relationship between different factors. The factors being observed in this data set are going to be especially relevant to me after graduating college when I am looking for my own place to live. It is very important to consider these factors in relation to the price I am going to be paying.
